=== CURRENT TRADING DATA ===
{data}

=== SCALPING DECISION NEEDED ===
Analyze this data for QUICK SCALPING opportunities:

üìä TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (USE THESE INDICATORS):
- RSI: Is it oversold (<30), overbought (>70), or neutral?
- MACD: Is it bullish/bearish? Is momentum increasing/decreasing?
- Moving Averages: Is price above/below SMA5, SMA10?
- Bollinger Bands: Is price at upper/middle/lower band?
- Stochastic: Is it oversold/overbought/neutral?
- Volume: Is it above/below average? Any spikes?

üí∞ PROFIT/LOSS STATUS:
- If you own this coin: Is it profitable? How much % gain/loss?
- Should you take quick profits (1-3% target) or cut losses?

‚ö° ENTRY/EXIT TIMING:
- Is this the right moment for a quick BUY scalp?
- Or should you SELL to take profits/cut losses?
- Is momentum building up or dying down?

Remember: This is SCALPING - quick in, quick out! Don't overthink, follow the momentum!""",
